The proposed input layer propagates a geometrically localized image sub-block (of image pixels) to each 40 hidden node in the hidden layer. In other words, each hidden node corresponds to a different sub-image block (see Fig. 1). Each propagated image block is then convolved with a set of Gabor kernels by means of vector projection followed by a magnitude function, a randomly weighted summation and a nonlinear activation function operations. The hidden node outputs are finally incorporated with a deterministically learned output weights layer to yield the final decision.\n",
